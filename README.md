# hello-world
First Repository.  Ready to lean this shit.

## Why am I here?
I began my first venture into learning to code on Codecademy in December of 2022.  I'm working very seriously at it now.  I'm nearly done with a full skill-path on SQL for Data Analysis.  
How does that get me to GitHub?  In addition to being a thing that I hear mentioned and I know nothing about (I hate that), another user on Codecademy recommended to me that I put my projects on GitHub for easier sharing.
That was the main impetus.  I want to be able to share my projects properly, and easily.
